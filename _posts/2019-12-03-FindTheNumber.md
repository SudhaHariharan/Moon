### Find The Missing Number
In the set of numbers below, 72 and 99 are "combined" to produce 27. Then 27 and 45 are "combined" to produce 18 and so on. The final 7 is not a misprint. What is x?

### Solution

It turns out that the number 27 is a sum of the digits of 72 and 99.

The same thing happens with 18.

Following this progression, x = 3+6+2+1 = 12
