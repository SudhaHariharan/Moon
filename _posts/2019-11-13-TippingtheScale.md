## Tipping the Scale
A balance scale sits on the teacher's table, currently tipped to the right. There is a set of weights on the scales, and on each weight is the name of at least one pupil. On entering the classroom, each pupil moves all the weights carrying his or her name to the opposite side of the scale. Prove that there is some set of pupils that you, the teacher, can let in which will tip the scales to the list. 

## Solution
Consider all subsets of students, including the empty set and the full set. Each weight will be on the left half the time, so the total weight on the left for all these subsets is the same as the total weight on the right. Since the empty set results in a tip to the right, some other set must other set must tip to the left.
