Each number from 1 to 10^10 is written out in formal English (e.g., two hundred eleven, one thousand forty two) and then listed in alphabetical order (as in a dictionary, where spaces and hyphens are ignored). Whats the first odd number in the list?

### Solution
The first would be a digit. Alphabeticall eight would come first. Earliest available word would be billion. Proceeding along these lines, one eventually gets the answer 8,018,018,885. 

By a similar processes, the first prime in the dictionary would be 8,018,018,881
