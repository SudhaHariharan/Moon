#### The Bixby Boys
It was the first day of class and Mrs. Feldman had two identical looking pupils, Donald and Ronald Bixby, sitting together in the first row. 
"You two are twins, I take it?" she asked.
"No", they replied in unison.
But a check of their records showed that they had the same parents and were born on the same day. How could this be?

#### Solution
They could be triplets/quadraplets and so on
