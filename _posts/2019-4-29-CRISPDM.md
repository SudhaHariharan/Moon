# CRISP-DM Methodology - An Introduction
In this document, I will talk about how to use the CRISP-DM methodology to extract value from data and accelerate the adoption of advanced analytics in the organization. 

## What is the CRISP-DM Methodology
CRISP-DM, which stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining, is an industry-proven way to guide your data mining efforts. The CRISP-DM methodology is practical, flexible and useful when solving business issues with analytics. This methodology was introduced in 1996 by 
Daimler Chrysler (then Daimler-Benz), SPSS (then ISL), and NCR (Teradata).

As a __methodology__,it includes descriptions of the typical phases of a project, the tasks involved in each phase, and an explanation of the relationships between these tasks. 

As a __process model__, it provides an overview of the data mining lifecycle. 

There are six major steps for applying the CRISP-DM methodology as illustrated in the diagram below. The arrows indicate the most important and frequent dependencies between the steps. The sequence of the steps is not strict. The outer circle in the diagram symbolizes the cyclic nature of the data mining process itself.

### Business Understanding
This initial phases focuses on understanding the project requirements and objectives from a business perspective and then converting this knowledge into a data mining problem definition and a preliminar plan designed to achieve the objectives. 

1. Set Business Objectives 

This will state what the client really wants to accomplish from a business perspective. The statement must help uncover important factors at the start that can influence the outcome of the project. 

2. Assess Current Situation

Assessing current situation can help uncover more details and facts about all the resources, constraints, assumptions, and other factors that must be considered.

3. Data mining Goals

Data mining objectives state project objectives in data mining terms (algorithm families, frameworks and techniques to be applied). 

4. Project planning:

This steps involving preparing a project plan that describes the intended plan for achieving the data mining goals and the business goals. The plan should specify the anticipated set of steps to be performed during the rest of the project including an initial selectionof tools and techniques. 

### Data Understanding

This phase startes with initial data collection, then gaining familiarity with the data and finally verfiy that the data is appropriate for your needs. 

The outcome could be identification of data quality problems, first insights into the data, or detect interesting subsets to form hypothesis for hidden information.  

The list of tasks that need to be completed during this phase are

1. Collect data:

* Outline data requriements from the project resources and verify data availability.
* Aquire the data listed in the project resources. 

2. Describe data:

* Examine the gross or surface properties of the acquired data
* Report on the results

3. Explore data:

* Tackles the data mining questions, which can be addressed using querying, visualization, and reporting:
	* Distribution of key attributes, results of simple aggregations.
	* Relations between pairs or small numbers of attributes.
	*Properties of significant sub-populations, simple statistical analyses.
* May address the data mining goals directly.
* May contribute to or refine the data description and quality reports.
* May feed into the transformation and other data preparation needed

4. Verify data quality

* Examine the quality of the data
* Find outliers.

### Data Preparation

This phase involvs all the activities that are needed to construct the final dataset. The tasks under this phase are likely to be performed multiple times and not in any prescribed order. These tasks include table, record, and attribute selection as well as transformation and cleaning of data that will feed the modeling tools.

The data preparation phase covers the following tasks:

1. Select data:

This is where you will decide what data you have access to and which will be used in your data mining activities.
You will have to articulate the rationale for using or not using the data (availability, volumes, quality, etc.).
2. Clean data:

Data is never perfect or clean; there are always inconsistencies, missing values, or even outliers.
You’ll most likely need to “adjust” by excluding some cases or individual variables by replacing some data with default values or with more sophisticated technique (like imputation).

3. Construct and integrate data:

This is where you will derive new variables, build aggregation, or merge datasets (tables).
This task will be heavily influenced by the data cleaning you executed before.

4. Format data:

Sometimes, the modeling tool requires specific formats to be applied to your mining dataset.

### Modeling

The modeling phase covers the following tasks
* Select the modeling technique
	* This selection will be based on your data mining objectives
	* Sometimes, multiple modeling techniques can be used to achieve the same data mining goal.

* Design test scenarios:
	* Before actually building the model, define the procedure or mechanism to test the model's quality and validity
	* Typically, you will seperate the data set into 'train' and 'test' set. 
	
* Build Model(s):
	* When building models, most tools give you the option of adjusting a variety of settings, and these settings have an impact on the structure of the final model.
	* Some model types can be easily translated into simple equations; others that are more complex may use more sophisticated formats.
	
* Model Assessment:
	* interpert the modles according to domain knowledge, the data mining success criteria, and the desired test designs. 

### Evaluation
During this phase, you will evaluate the model(s) and review the previous steps to confirm that the business ibjectives are met. At the end of this phase, you will be able to decide whether the produced results, insights and issues shouwl be used.

This phase consists of the following tasks. 

* Evaluate results	
	* Assess the degree to which the model meets the business objectives.
	* Determine if there is some business reason why this model is deficient
	* Test the model(s) on real test applications if time and budget constraints permit.
	* Assess any other data mining results generated. 
	* Identify additional challenges, information, or hints for future directions. 
* Reviewing the process
	* Conduct a through review of the data minign engagement in order to determine if there are important tasks or factors that have been overlooked.
	* Review any quality assurance issues
	* Ensure the model was built correctly
* Determine next steps	
	* Decide whether to complete the project and move to deployment, or initiate further iterations, or setup a new data mining project.
	* Determine if there are any remaining resources or budget constraints that influences the decision. 
	
### Deployment
The deployment phase can be as simple as generating a report or as complex as implementing a repeatable data mining process across the enterprise.

The deployment phase covers the following tasks
* Planning deployment
	* Deploy the data mining result into the business
	* Document the procedure for future deployment.
* Planning monitoring and maintenance:
	* Here the data mining results become part of the day-to-day business environment
	* This helps to avoid long periods of incorrect usage of the data minign results
	* requires a detailed monitoring process
* Reporting final results
	* a final report is written
	* This might only be a summary of the project and experiences
	* It could be a final and comprehensive presentation of the data minign results. 
* Reviewing project
	* Assess what went right and what went wrong, what needs to be improved and what was done well.
