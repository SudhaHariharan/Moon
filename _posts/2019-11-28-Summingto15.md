#### Summing to 15 
Alice and Bob alternatively choose numbers from among 1,2,3....9 without replacement. The first to obtain 3 numbers which sum to 15 wins. Does Alice (the first to play have a winning strategy?

#### Solution
The quick way to solve the puzzle is to imagine that Alice and Bob are playing on the following magic square:

| 8 	| 1 	| 6 	|
| 3 	| 5 	| 7 	|
| 4 	| 9 	| 2 	|

Since it is exactly the rows, columns, and main diagonals which sum to 15 they are playing Tic Tac Toe. 

The best play in tic-tac-toe leads to a draw, so Alice cannot have a winning strategy.
