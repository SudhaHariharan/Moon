## Watches on the table

Fifty accurate watches lie on a table. Prove that there exists a moment in time when the sum of the distances from the center of the table to the ends of the minute hands is more than the sum of the distances from the center of the table to the centers of the watches. 

## Solution

Considering just one watch, we claim that during the passing of an hour, the average distance from the center C of the table to the tip M of th eminute hand exceeds the distance from C to the center W of the watch. This is so because if we draw a line L through C perpendicular to th eline from C to W, then then average distance from L to M is clearly equal to LW which is in turn equal to CW. But CM is at least equal to LM and usually bigger.

If we sum over all of the watches we reach the same conclusion, and it follows that sometime during the hour the desired inequality is achieved.
