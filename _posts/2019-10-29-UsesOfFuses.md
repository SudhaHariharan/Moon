#### Uses of Fuses

You are presented with two fuses (lengths of string), each of which will burn for exactly 1 minute, but not uniformly along its length. Can you use them to measure 45 seconds?

#### Solution
Light the first fuse at both ends and the second fuse at only one end. The first fuse burns out at 30 seconds. At this point, light the second end of the second fuse. It would take another 15 seconds to burn out totalling to 45 seconds.

It is possible that with a single fuse you can time any fraction 1/nth of an hour - by snipping it into pieces and always keep n ends burning. 

For example to measure 20 seconds: Snip the first fuse into 3 pieces. Together they take 60 seconds to burn. Instead burn the ends of all 3 pieces together to give 20 seconds. 

With two fuses, any franction 1/n + 1/m can be measured. If we want to measure 50 seconds..this can be split as 30 and 20. Burn the two ends of the first fuse for 30 seconds. And burn the ends of the seconds fuse, split into 3 for 20 seconds.
