## Math problem 
What is 6 / 2(1+2) ?
This problem often generated debate and has millions of comments on social networks.

## Solution
The standard order of operations is PEDMAS/BODMAS that stands for Paranthesis/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition and finally Subtraction.

So the expression evaluates to first performing addition inside the paranthesis
6 / 2(1+2) = 6 / 2(3)

Modern computers, calculators, google, wolfram alpha will compute the expression as follows:
Since division and multiplication have the same precedence, the correct order is to evaluate from left to right. First take 6 and divide it by 2 and then multiply by 3

6 / 2 * 3 = 3 * 3 = 9

According to the current usage, this is the correct answer.

However, historically the symbol รท was used to mean you should divide the entire product on the right of the symbol. So,

6 รท 2(3) = 6 รท 6 = 1

Note that this is an outdated usage.
