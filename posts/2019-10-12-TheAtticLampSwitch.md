#### The Attic Lamp Switch
A downstairs panel contains three on-off switches, one of which controls the lamp in the attic - but which one? Your mission is do something with the switches, then determine after one trip to the attic which switch is connected to the attic lamp.

#### Solution
Light bulbs get hot when they are on.
Switch on first switch for a while and switch off.
Switch off last switch and visit the attic.

If the light is off and bulb is hot - the bulb is connected to switch 1.
If the light is off and bulb is cold - the bulb is connected to switch 2.
If the light is on - the bulb is connected to switch 3.
