#### Weight of Cat
One chicken has the same weight as one cat plus one owl; two chickens have the same weight as three turtles; and one owl plus one turtle together balance with one cat. What is the weight of one cat in terms of owls?

#### Solution
chicken = cat + owl .....(1)
2chicken = 3turtles .....(2)
owl + turtle = cat ......(3)

replacing cat in (1) with (3)
chicken = owl + turtle + owl
chicken = 2owl + turtle

Multiplying both sides with 2
2chicken = 4owl + 2turtles

Subtracting from (2)
3turtles = 4owl + 2turtles
turtles = 4owl

substituting in (3)
cat = owl + 4 owl

cat = 5owl.
