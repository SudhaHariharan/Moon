## 1000 Euro problem
The following problem is from the Finnish Matriculation Exam in 2014, which had an award of 1000 Euros for a perfect score.

The problem: Consider the equation 
ax<sup>2</sup> - 5x + 2 = 0
Solve for a such that the equation has only one solution

## Solution

For the equation to have only one solution, using brahmaguptas quadratic formula

we have b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac = 0
25 - 8a = 0
a = 25/8

However, the above equation can also have one solution if a = 0
that is -5x + 2 = 0.

The trick here is to also consider the second case. Therefore there are two values for which the original equation gives a single solution: a = 25/8 or a = 0.
