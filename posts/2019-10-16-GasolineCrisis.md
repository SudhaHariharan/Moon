#### Gasoline Crisis
There is a gasoline crisis and the fuel stations located on a long circular route together contain just enough gas to make one trip around. Prove that if you start at the right station with an empty tank, you can make it all the way around.

#### Solution
Solution from cut-the-knot.org

Start at any station and mind to record the amount of gasoline on reaching gas stations on your way around. At the end of the trip, when you pull into the station of departure with the original amount of gas, check your list. The station marked with the least number is the one where you want to start on an empty tank.

Assume the least amount in question was, say, K gallons. Assume also you can start your second trip with this amount of gasoline. As before, as you go, record the amounts of fuel on reaching the gas stations on your way around the trek. The list of numbers wull be the same as on the first trip but shifted circularly. THis, if you remove K from each of the numbers on the list, none of the numbers will become negative.
